# Obsidian Cloudflare AI Plugin

A plugin for Obsidian that adds an AI assistant with RAG functionality via Cloudflare AI.

## Features

- ü§ñ Chat with AI through [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) using their provided [Models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/).
- üìù Sync your Obsidian notes to a [Cloudflare Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/) index.
- üîÑ Auto-sync your Obsidian notes to the Vectorize index at a set interval.
  - You can also ignore folders if you don't want to sync them.
  - State is saved in the `.cloudflare-ai/sync` folder, this ensures that we don't sync the same note multiple times.

This is currently a work in progress, however, for now, here's a quick preview of the chat with a response that uses matching notes for context:

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out how to stream responses in (may be a problem with `request` from Obsidian, which we need to use to avoid CORS, maybe need an alternative).
- [ ] Add the ability to send properties in the metadata.
- [ ] Add filtering of the RAG results.

- [ ] Look at adding other providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.
- [ ] Make the UI nicer where possible.
