# Obsidian Cloudflare AI Plugin

A plugin for Obsidian that adds an AI assistant with RAG functionality via Cloudflare AI.

## Features

- ü§ñ Chat with AI through [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) using their provided [Models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/).
- üìù Sync your Obsidian notes to a [Cloudflare Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/) index.
- üîÑ Auto-sync your Obsidian notes to the Vectorize index at a set interval.

This is currently a work in progress, however, for now, here's a quick preview of the chat with a response that uses matching notes for context:

## TODO

- [ ] Add a way to track what notes have been synced and when so we can avoid syncing the same note multiple times.
- [ ] Make sure that editing settings applies them immediately.
- [ ] Add the ability to send properties in the metadata.
- [ ] Add a minimum score for matches
- [ ] Make top_k configurable
- [ ] Add filtering of the RAG results.
```
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/vectorize/v2/indexes/$INDEX_NAME/query \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H "X-Auth-Email: $CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL" \
    -H "X-Auth-Key: $CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
      "vector": [
        0.5,
        0.5,
        0.5
      ],
      "filter": {
        "has_viewed": {
          "$ne": true
        },
        "streaming_platform": "netflix"
      },
      "topK": 5
    }'
```
- [ ] Add a way to delete notes from the Vectorize index.
- [ ] Auto delete notes from the Vectorize index if they are deleted from Obsidian.
- [ ] Add a text generation mode when you can insert the response into the current note.
- [ ] Add an image generation mode when you can insert the response into the current note.
- [ ] Add a speech to text mode.
- [ ] Look at adding other providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.
- [ ] Make the UI nicer where possible.
- [ ] Figure out how to stream responses in (may be a problem with `request` from Obsidian, which we need to use to avoid CORS, maybe need an alternative).
